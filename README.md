JLib is an ACS library, it compatible with Zandronum and GZDoom, and <ins>can be used only in ACS compiled with Zt-BCC</ins>.

### JLib provides the following list of features and functions:
- Creating vectors (2D, 3D, 4D)
- Rotating 3D and 2D points by all 3 axes
- Converting Cartesian XYZ coordinates into Polar R.A.P.<sup>_(**R**adius, **A**ngle, **P**itch)_</sup> coordinates and vise-versa
- Angle conversion functions (Byte angles, normalized(fixed-point) angles, integer degrees and fixed-point degrees conversions)
- Extra trigonometry (Tan, Csc, Ctg etc)
- Extra integer, fixed-point and any-number-type math functions (Bounce, Mean, Clamp, Map, HalfPoint etc)
- Different types of 3D→2D projections (and also UE 2.5 "Corona"-styled projection)
- Virtual HUD scaling functions (FullScreenVFHUD, RatioMap, GetWndRatio, GetRatioScaling etc)
- Color space conversions (RGBA8::To_RGB8, RGB8::From_NV3)
- Type aliases that can be used everywhere (RGBA8_, NAng_, Flags_, Num_, UInt8 etc)
- Short function aliases (FxD, FxM, SetTID, ACS_NCall etc)
